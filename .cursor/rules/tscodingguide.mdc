# TypeScript AI Coding Guidelines

Guidelines for AI assistants to produce high-quality, maintainable TypeScript code.

## Core Principles

- Read documentation first before making any changes.
- Make changes file-by-file.
- Preserve existing code and project structure.
- Focus only on the changes requested.
- No inventions - don't add features not explicitly requested.
- Keep it simple - choose simpler approaches over complex ones.

## Project Structure

- Use modern TypeScript with ESM modules (import/export syntax).
- Avoid libraries requiring CommonJS (require) or without TypeScript definitions.
- Use strict TypeScript mode.
- Never modify configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.) without explicit permission.
- If a bug requires configuration changes, suggest the changes first and wait for approval.

## Code Size Limits

- Keep units small and focused:
  - Files: less than 200 instructions
  - Classes: less than 10 public methods/properties 
  - Functions: maximum 20 instructions

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Start boolean variables with verbs (is, has, can).
- Start functions with verbs.
- Avoid abbreviations except for standard ones (API, URL, i, j, err, ctx, req, res).
- Use descriptive names that clearly communicate purpose.

## Code Quality

- Declare explicit types for:
  - Function parameters and return values
  - Exported variables and constants
  - Public class members
- Use type inference for local variables when the inferred type is clear and unambiguous.
- Avoid using `any`. Prefer precise types or use `unknown` with narrowing.- Create necessary custom types.
- Avoid magic numbers:
  - Use named constants for values with domain-specific meaning (e.g., timeouts, thresholds, retry limits).
  - Allow literals like `0`, `1`, `-1`, and small loop counters unless the meaning is ambiguous.
  - Prefer descriptive constant names over repeating the same literal in multiple places.
- Handle edge cases (empty arrays, null values, undefined inputs).
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Implement appropriate error handling with clear messages.
- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Prefer immutability for data.
- Avoid deep nesting by flattening control flow where possible:
  - Use guard clauses instead of `if/else` when the `if` block ends in `return`, `throw`, or `continue`.
  - Prefer `return` early to exit invalid conditions before proceeding with main logic.
  - Extract complex conditional logic into named functions or predicates.
  - Replace nested loops with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` where appropriate.
- Avoid using `continue` in loops unless it clearly improves readability.
  - Prefer structured control flow with early returns or extracted functions.
  - If `continue` is used, ensure the loop body remains shallow and predictable.

## Dependencies

- Minimize third-party libraries.
- Each dependency must be justified.
- Favor standard library solutions when possible (e.g., use native fetch API instead of Axios for HTTP requests).

## Modular Architecture

- Ensure clear separation of concerns.
- Use well-defined interfaces between components.
- Components should interact only through their public interfaces.
- Follow existing project architecture patterns.

## Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Write unit tests for public functions.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
- Name test variables clearly (inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX).

Remember: When in doubt, choose simplicity and maintainability over complexity and premature optimization.
Note: This guide does not use code examples. AI agents are expected to infer behavior exclusively from explicit rules and declarative instructions. This encourages structured reasoning over pattern imitation.
